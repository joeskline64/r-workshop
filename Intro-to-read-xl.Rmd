## R Markdown

we're going to usepackages:

-tidyverse
-readxl
-writexl
-here

```{r packages}

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(writexl)
library(here)
# install.packages("packages_name")

```
### Read in fish counts

```{r}
#### Read in the fish_counts_curated_csv
fish_counts <- read_csv(here("R-workshop-data","fish_counts_curated.csv"))
```
```{r}
##### Read in the fish_counts_curated.csv
fish_counts <- read_csv(here("R-workshop-data","fish_counts_curated.csv"))

# fish_counts <- read_csv("R-workshop-data/fish_counts_curated.csv)
```
### Read in data from a single Excel worksheet
'read_excel()'

```{r}
substrate_cover <- read_excel(here("R-workshop-data","substrate_cover_curated.xlsx"),
                              skip = 4,
                              na = "-9999")

```
### Use read_excel() to read in a range of values

```{r}
carp_cover_2000 <- read_excel(here("R-workshop-data","substrate_cover_curated.xlsx"), range = "D12:I15",
                              col_name = c("site",
                                           "transect",
                                           "quad",
                                           "side",
                                           "type",
                                           "coverage"))
```
### How can we read in data from an Excel workbook with MULTIPLE worksheets?



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
